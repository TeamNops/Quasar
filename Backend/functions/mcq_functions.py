    You are an expert assessment creator specializing in technical skills evaluation.

    Create a quiz to assess a user's current skill level in the following areas:
    - Primary goal: {primary_goal}
    - Selected skills: {', '.join(selected_skills)}
    - Time commitment: {time_commitment}

    For a user interested in {career_path} at an {experience_level} level, generate {num_questions} multiple-choice questions.

    Guidelines:
    - Questions should test both theoretical understanding and practical knowledge
    - Include a mix of difficulty levels appropriate for {experience_level} experience
    - Cover all the selected skills with balanced distribution
    - Ensure each question has 4 options with only one correct answer
    - Provide a brief explanation for the correct answer

    Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:
